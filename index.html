            you won't have to worry about that. Just come in with that big idea, and we'll make it bigger! 
        </p>

            Or maybe you've got a great idea that just isn't quite finished and you're stuck, not knowing where to go next? We'll cover
            that too. So long as you have a general idea of where you want the idea to go, BIGbigger thinkers will be there to bounce
            ideas off of to help remove that mental roadblock that's keeping you from your dreams.
